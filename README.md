### MeigoWEB is a web platform dedicated to the field of sales, specifically 3D print object.
The application is divided into 5 parts:
```
1. Identity management part: it is responsible for the user authentication and registration 
                             part as well as the role management part. For the server side 
                             I used IdentityServer 8 with JWT Token and RefreshToken.  
```
```
2. Profile Management part: It is responsible for enabling users to access and modify their account information, 
                             including personal details such as first name, last name, address, and phone number. 
                             This section ensures secure data handling and provides a user-friendly interface for profile updates.
```
```
3. Products Page part: It provides functionality to categorize products and display each product on a separate page. 
                             Detailed product information, including images, is shown, and users can add items to their shopping cart. 
                             The backend ensures efficient data retrieval and smooth navigation between products.
```
```
4. Shopping Cart Section part: It manages the user's shopping cart, allowing users to view and modify its contents. 
                             Features include adjusting the quantity of a product or removing items. 
                             The system ensures consistency between the frontend and backend to maintain accurate cart data.
```
```
5. Checkout Section part: It handles the final step of the purchase process, enabling users to verify or manually enter their delivery address. 
                             The system automatically populates the address from the profile section, ensuring seamless integration and a smooth user experience.
